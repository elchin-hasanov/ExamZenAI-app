    "essay": "Our lives are defined by our rituals. As we grow, we discover these rituals, grow accustomed to them, and either move on to newer experiences and routines, or in some cases, cling onto them our entire lives. Rituals are often associated with primitive deity worshiping dances around a mystical fire, but the truth is, there is ritual in everything we do. There is ritual in waking up and attending school each day, working a 9-5 job and even ritual in the way we play with our hair when we’re nervous, the way we consent to our parents expectations and the way we laugh too hard at our crush’s jokes. As literature is essentially a mirror to the human soul, it also contains these ritualistic elements. Both Henrik Ibsen’s A Doll’s House and Tennessee William’s A Streetcar Named Desire explore the notion of ritual by presenting to an audience the recurring mannerisms and nuances that shape their characters’ identities and relationships. Because both these plays are created on the structures of realism, they strive to capture the daily habitual rituals that are small acts, but significant indications of who we are as people. Thus, by showcasing these rituals, both Ibsen and Williams reflect different essences of humanity that are relevant and authentic in our own style.\nIn both plays, context shapes each character's experiences, thus affecting the types of rituals these characters embody. In A Doll’s House, the play was published in 1879 Norway during a time in history where gender roles were distinctly defined and upheld. Women were extremely restricted to playing the doll-like wife that aided in the strive to attain the Bourgeois respectability - an image of wealth, security, and a glossy appearance of happiness. These cultural factors therefore influenced the rituals between man and woman. Throughout the play, the female protagonist, Nora, strives to satisfy her husband, Torvald. In Act 2, she dances the Tarantella for her husband, urging him to “correct her”. He barks orders at her as she dances in a crazed frenzy, her “hair falling to her shoulders”, as she attempts to do as she is told. This teacher-student relationship between Nora and Torvald is a recurring motif throughout the play - a ritual that is shaped by the patriarchal society present in 1879 Norway. The significance of Nora dancing the Tarantella for her husband, and later on, for her guests is both a cultural Christmas ritual, as well as a metaphor for how a middle class family in Norway during the 19th century would put on “performances'' that masked their inner turmoil with an artificial spectacle of success.\nIn contrast, A Streetcar Named Desire takes place in a post WWII New Orleans during a time where the American people were still experiencing the after-effects of loss and recovery from the Great Depression. The stage directions at the start of Act 1 encompass these socio-economic conditions effectively with the “rickety staircases” and the off-white weathered homes. The atmosphere of the play is sultry, and open, which help shape the ritualistic behaviors of Williams’ characters. Stanley Kowalski’s rituals include drunken poker nights with his male buddies, and a glass of liquor each time he returns home. These rituals stem from socio-economic conditions and give the audience insight into Stanley Kowalski’s rough “animalistic” and “primitive” kind of character. The stage directions throughout the play also appeal to the audience’s auditory senses, introducing the sensual musical effects of a Blue Piano, and at times, the tune of the Polka. These musical details further help shape the context of the play, and are also atmospheric rituals that help shape the lives of Williams’ characters.\nRituals are also found in speech, and in both A Doll’s House and A Streetcar Named Desire, ritualistic speech helps Williams and Ibsen further define their characters. In A Doll’s House, Torvald often refers to Nora as his “little squirrel” - a repetitive speech pattern Ibsen employs to demonstrate how Torvald regards Nora. Nora’s speech also contains patterns of superficiality, whether it be her hysterics over having the perfect Christmas, or her need to be a good wife and make Torvald happy. It is not until Act 3 that her speech rituals change as she voices how “absolutely certain” she is about learning her home to honor those “duties to herself” rather than only her duties to her husband and to her children. This change in tone from hysterical and superficial to grave and certain demonstrates a change in speech ritual, and suggests a change in how she views herself and her role in society.\nIn A Streetcar Named Desire, Williams’ characters also embody distinct speech rituals. Stanley’s first line of the play is him “bellowing” out to Stella, calling out “Hey, Stella baby, hey!” as he chucks a package of meat to his wife. This speech and physical ritual is repeated throughout the play, highlighted later on when he beats Stella in Scene 4. These rituals show Stanley’s animalistic, alpha male identity. Conversely, Blanche Dubois’ last line in Scene 1 is “I think I’m going to be sick” - a line that embodies the fragility of her “moth”-like character. Throughout the play, her repetitive need to bathe, and her frazzled and anxious speech and actions showcase the kinds of rituals she possesses. From these rituals, the audience better understands the nature of her character.\nUltimately, these rituals in literature not only help us better understand the characters and their motives, but they also help us better understand ourselves and our own rituals. Theater provides an audience with a detached third person perspective on life. The messages we take in and the rituals we observe on stage help us reflect on our own identities and views on the world.",
