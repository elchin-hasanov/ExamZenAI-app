        "Authors use their literary work to send a message to the world. Whether it be to reveal an important aspect of history, to celebrate someone’s life, or even to criticize our society. Authors can criticize mankind and society through their work in various ways, one method being the portrayal of characters that are somehow trapped. Though this is not true of all plays or written works, in Sizwe Banzi is Dead Athol Fugard and Death and the Maiden by Ariel Dorfman, this is true to a very large extent. Both authors wrote these plays to bring into light the flaws of our society in the past and present. With Fugard, his play was written to portray the injustice and the obstacles the oppressed groups had to face during the Apartheid. With Dorfman, his play worked to provide a voice for those who have been under an oppressive power (be it a government or a tormenter) and are still recovering from their suffering. Fugard, an Afrikaner, worked within the Native Commissioners Court in South Africa where he was able to witness first hand the injustice and cruelty black South Africans had to face under the strict and racist laws. Dorfman also worked directly under Allende, a Chilean leader who was overthrown by the Dictator Pinochet in 1973. Both authors directly worked with oppressive governments and witnessed firsthand the effects it had on the people. While the type of entrapment and social conditions are vastly different, these playwrights both use political, economic, and social forms of entrapment to harshly criticize the oppressive regimes that devalue, restrict and even damage the individual.",
        "The characters in both works are portrayed as trapped under a variety of forces, one of the forces being politically trapped under an oppressive system. The government during Apartheid and of a dictatorship is a specific system that traps our characters and that the authors aim to criticize. In Sizwe Banzi our characters are trapped in an unjust government of the Apartheid, a series of over 300 laws and regulations use to dictate and suppress the lives of many peoples. The character Sizwe is trapped in this system as his passbook holds a negative stamp forcing him to leave Port Elizabeth. This passbook acts as a symbol of Apartheid and lies at the center of the play. The playbook/program of the play when it was staged in Cape Town was a facsimile of a passbook. Though unfair, Sizwe does not have a choice because the pass laws dictate what he can and cannot do, “if the book says you go, you go.” His mentor, Buntu, helps to raise Sizwe’s awareness of his play. However, Sizwe must work in Port Elizabeth to provide for his family and must choose between abandoning his name and stealing another man’s identity or be kicked out of Port Elizabeth. Fugard uses the technique of breaking the fourth wall in order to directly show to the audience the struggling conflicts that black South Africans must face for survival. In one scene Sizwe rips off his clothes and screams at the audience : “Look at me, I am a man.” His pleading tone, his actions, and his direct speech to the audience epitomizes his victimization and how vulnerable and trapped he is in this system. By breaking the 4th wall, he exposes himself to the audience to show that he is human, just like all of us. This breaking of the 4th wall is also seen in Death and the Maiden when the mirror descends. While this is different from Sizwe talking directly to the audience, both examples force the audience to think about the trapped condition of characters. Yet the government system discriminates against him. Fugard uses the entrapment of Sizwe to criticize the unfairness and racism of the pass laws.",
        "Similarly, in Death and the Maiden the characters are also trapped under a government system. Though their nation was recently free from dictatorship and now runs under a democracy, the people are still trapped and suffering from the long term effects of their previous oppressive government. This is slightly different from Sizwe as he is suffering under an existing system. Paulina, a victim of dictatorship’s war crimes and torturing is still haunted by her past. She can no longer listen to the Schubert symphony as it was played during her torture. Unlike Sizwe, Paulina’s feelings of entrapment come from something that happened in the past. The Schubert symphony can be used as a symbol to show the struggle of freeing oneself from the effects of our past. In Sizwe Bansi is Dead, Fugard also uses symbols to show Sizwe’s limitations. Gerardo, who works in the commission and is fighting for justice, is conflicted as the system supports the death sentence. He is trapped within the system in the sense that he aims to provide justice for his people but does not support the system that does this. Dorfman also creates a tense and anxious mood in the play. The use of darkness, stark flashes of lighting, and eerie sounds conveys this continuous sense of uneasiness. This shows how the people, though freed from dictatorship, are still not freed from its effect and still feel scared and paranoid, much like Black South Africans are trapped in Apartheid. As Gerardo states, they “aren’t used to...democracy.” Dorfman creates this image of fear and uneasiness to criticize the dictatorship rule and show how the people are still trapped in its shadows. Though Dorfman’s direct experience is with Chile, his play criticizes any nation or society under a dictatorship or oppressive government.",
        "Characters in both works are not only trapped under a government, but also can be trapped economically or socially. In Sizwe Banzi, Styles' character explains his experience in the Ford Factory which criticizes the system of Western Corporations investments in South Africa. In Styles' monologue he reenacts and elaborates on the dangerous conditions in the factory. This economic disparity is a clear difference from Dorfman’s play which is not about economic oppression. The workers are only provided with safety concerns and good quality equipment when the corporate boss Henry Ford comes in to pay a quick visit. Unlike Dorfman, Fugard uses a monologue and an emphasis on physicality in this scene to emphasize the conditions of the workers. Their assembly line, their “mask of smiles”, and what jobs they are stuck in due to this oppressive system of Western Corporations. Fugard relies extensively on physicality during this monologue to try and provide a vivid image for the audience and to address them directly about the concerns of this system. Like shown in the previous example, Fugard portrays our character as trapped within a system so the audience provides sympathy for them and is able to understand the message he is trying to get across, that these characters represent those in the real world who suffer from unjust systems.",
        "While Paulina is not trapped economically, she does feel trapped socially and faces gender discrimination. In Death and the Maiden, when seen through a feminist lens, it can be observed the Paulina is trapped in an anti-feminist society. Dorfman initially portrays Paulina as the victim. Like Sizwe, Paulina is vulnerable, scared, and in a constant state of paranoia, and she is shown as weak. Her husband Gerardo also has power over her. He makes decisions without telling her, he cheats on her, and he victimizes her. The setting of the house itself is a symbol of Paulina’s entrapment. She feels uneasy even within the walls of her own house. Her victimization is highlighted by the dim lighting, the gun that she mysteriously pulls out in the opening scene, the eerie sound of the waves. Dorfman portrays Paulina as ‘trapped’ in order to criticize the oppressive nature of an anti-feminist mindset and how it can make victims feel scared and uncomfortable even in their house. This feminist system is criticized as at the time the play was written, the machismo mind set- that males were more dominant, was a strong influence in South America. Dorfman criticizes this mindset through his portrayal of Paulina much like Fugard attacks Apartheid through Styles and Sizwe.",
        "Both authors depict their character as trapped under an oppressive system to criticize our society, however they are also shown as trapped within themselves. In Sizwe Banzi, Fugard shows how characters can be trapped psychologically or internally conflicted. Styles' previous job was in the Ford Factory. He hated his work, he felt trapped in this job “like a circus monkey” and did not feel like his life belonged to himself. He had “sold his life away” to a meaningless system. He was conflicted about whether or not he should abandon his job and pursue his dreams in photography. This internal struggle was also used to portray how the unjust and oppressive society they were in caused dilemmas within themselves. Sizwe also goes through an internal battle as he had to choose between, abandoning his name, his identity, for someone else’s with a clean pass book. Sizwe’s struggles were shown in his back-and-forth dialogue with Buntu in which Buntu ultimately reduced Sizwe’s identity to be defined by a mere number. This might be compared to Paulina’s internal struggle seen in her dialogue with Gerardo. The characters again directly address the audience to show their desperation and Sizwe’s internal struggle. Ultimately, he gives up his name and assumes the identity of Robert Zwelinzima in order to use his pass book and remain in Port Elizabeth. Sizwe’s internal battle illustrates the entrapment these oppressed victims feel and what they must sacrifice in order to survive. The characters in both plays evoke sympathy from the audience as their oppressed society forces them to have internal struggles and make sacrifices in order to survive.",
        "In Death and the Maiden a psychological form of entrapment is also evident in Paulina’s character. Her constant power struggle to move from victim to oppressor shows how haunted she is from her past. The only way she is able to face her fear was to use violence against her suspected tormenter. This is a stark difference from Sizwe who uses nonviolent means to solve his problem. However, this cycle of violence and terror shows the long term effects of an oppressive rule on their society as Paulina is permanently scarred from her years of abuse. The Schubert symphony again is used as a symbol to show how Paulina is not able to let go of her past, but also used to mimic her internal battle with her fragile mental state. The portrayal of Paulina as a victim trapped in her own mind highlights the long term negative effects of an oppressive society. Paulina’s fragile state of mind is emphasized by her questionable and cruel actions of tying up her guest and threatening to kill him. Paulina also uses idiosyncratic phrases such as “teensy weensy” or “real real truth” in order to manipulate her victim. However, Dorfman uses these parallel phrases to highlight how a society of terror and oppression will perpetuate this system of violence. Paulina’s psychological and mental entrapment conveys Dorfman’s criticism of the negative long term effects an oppressive system has on its people.",
        "Both plays portray their characters in some form of entrapment. Trapped under a government, an unjust system, or even trapped within their own mental states. Though a lot of these characters ultimately are free from their enslavement, (Styles opening up his photo studio and Paulina and Gerardo attending a concert and listening to Schubert again), both plays’ endings point out that the effects of these oppressive societies still exist. In Death and the Maiden a mirror descends forcing the audience to reflect on themselves. Dorfman also uses the alienation method in order to directly involve the audience in the play to show that these characters, these victims fighting to free themselves are in our world as well. In Sizwe Banzi, the play closes with Sizwe, now Robert, smiling for a photograph. The last sentence: “Smile...” shows how Sizwe Banzi is still trapped behind his mask of smiles, and must live his life continuing to fight the system. Both plays’ endings show that the implications of these oppressive systems are still in our society today and many victims are still trapped and fighting to break free."
