        "Humans are frail. Through the portrayal of individual weakness in several characters, both Sizwe Banzi is Dead by Athol Fugard and Death and the Maiden by Ariel Dorfman are able to serve as microcosms for unjust societies. ",
        "Sizwe Banzi is Dead is believed to have been inspired by the political situation of South Africa. Athol Fugard, an Afrikaner, had worked for the Native Commissioners Court in South Africa, where he witnessed the oppression and injustice that black South Africans faced every day under Apartheid. ",
        "Black South Africans were given few rights and forced to carry a passbook everywhere they went. He used this as the primary weakness of Sizwe Banzi in his play. ",
        "While it is never explicitly stated, one might assume that the inspiration behind Ariel Dorfman’s play Death and the Maiden and its setting was inspired by Chile in the 1970’s. ",
        "Dorfman worked under Allende who had been a Chilean leader until he was overthrown by the Dictator Pinochet in 1973. During Pinochet’s ruling, many Chilean citizens were tortured and abused, much like the character Paulina in his play. ",
        "Her weakness is her inability to forget, while Sizwe’s is his inability to give up his name. ",
        "While the portrayal of individual weakness in Sizwe Banzi is Dead by Athol Fugard and Death and the Maiden by Ariel Dorfman is very different, both plays do so in order to create an accurate representation of the oppressed living in unjust societies. ",
        "In both “DATM” and “SBID”, lighting is used as an aid to portray individual weakness within the characters. In “DATM”, Paulina constantly hides in the dark, listening and waiting. ",
        "In the very first scene of the play she hides behind a curtain with a gun because the lights of her husband's car remind her of the police. In the scene directions, Dorfman writes that the lights “blast her” and this invasive diction helps to show Paulina’s vulnerability and fear. ",
        "For years when she was tortured by the Doctor, Paulina was blindfolded as they tortured and abused her. Even now, 15 years later in her own home, Paulina feels safest in the dark where things are unclear. ",
        "This is used to exemplify Paulina’s inability to move on. It has been 15 years since she was last tortured and yet she has “done nothing with [her] life” except cower in fear. However, this later changes once Paulina finds her torturer sleeping in her own home. ",
        "Sizwe Banzi is Dead (SBID) too utilizes lighting as an aid in the portrayal of individual weakness. However, instead of using the dark, “SBID” utilizes the light to exemplify Sizwe’s weakness. ",
        "It is not until Sizwe’s monologue begins that we learn of the secrets that hide behind his smile. As everything around him turns to black, a spotlight hits Sizwe as he begins his story. ",
        "The flashing of the light also symbolizes a flashbulb which supports the photography motif that runs throughout the play. The monologue in the voiceover represents a letter that Sizwe writes to his wife saying that he can no longer be Sizwe, but rather Robert. ",
        "One of Sizwe’s weaknesses within the play is his secret, because if anyone were to find out, he would be deported from Port Elizabeth and punished for his crime. ",
        "The spotlight on him allows for his truth to be told, a truth that no one in his society would see as morally right, or even bother to hear. Sadly, it is due to the sole fact that the very color of their “skin is trouble” that this secret becomes his weakness. ",
        "One of the key devices used to portray individual weakness in both plays is the utilization of actions as shown in the scene directions. Paulina cowering in fear, away from the light is one example of this. ",
        "Another action is her inability to listen to her Schubert since the time of her torture. Prior to her abuse, Paulina was once able to leave the house, to be educated, to listen to the very music that once brought her joy. ",
        "But over the years that she was abused, the Doctor would play Paulina’s Schubert when she was raped and called names. When she was finally released, she came home to an unfaithful husband, keeping all that had happened to her locked inside. ",
        "She did not finish her education, nor did she ever leave their beach house, and it is not until she finds her torturer is Paulina able to listen to her Schubert again. ",
        "By the end of the play we see Paulina out again, and while in many ways she has overcome her weaknesses, she is also still silent and reminded of Roberto. ",
        "Like Paulina who shows her weakness through her actions, the actions of Sizwe are used to bring out his individual weakness as well. ",
        "After meeting with Buntu and being told that “if the book says go, you go” the two head to Sky’s Place to drink away their pain. This is an interesting difference to Paulina. While she cowers and hides to show her weakness, Sizwe goes to drown his sorrows. ",
        "In spite of this difference, what remains the same, however, is that they are both in denial of their weakness. Upon leaving, Buntu disappears into the dark to “take a piss,” only to come running back at the sight of a dead man. ",
        "As the two begin to argue over what to do, Sizwe wants to take the man’s body and bring it somewhere safe and suitable for a human being, but Buntu quickly states that that cannot be done. ",
        "If they were to be caught by the police there would be no right and wrong, the police would not need to know the truth to take them to jail, and they would just simply do so because Bunto and Sizwe’s “skin is trouble”. ",
        "It is this realization and loss of his naiveté that causes Sizwe to immediately strip off his clothes, bearing himself to the audience as he exclaims “Look at me, I am a man”. ",
        "He is human, he is a father and a husband, as is the man who lies dead in the trash covered in piss. This act of slipping his clothes symbolizes his epiphany regarding his own weakness as a Black South African. ",
        "But despite all of this - his people, their people, and the people of dreams are seen as just as worthless as a pile of garbage. Sizwe’s actions exemplify his confusion and anger towards his oppressive and unjust society. ",
        "He is thought to be weak because of the color of his skin, and it is this realization that reveals his individual weakness. ",
        "Dorfman and Fugard both use dialogue in order to further establish the weaknesses that we cannot always see. In “DATM” Paulina and Gerardo are married and in love, but between them, there are many secrets, interruptions, and silences. ",
        "These interruptions in their dialogue intensify the lack of trust between the two characters. They love one another, but are not completely honest until 15 years later. ",
        "Both characters have each other as a weakness, constantly interrupting and being interrupted by the other while searching for the “real real truth”. ",
        "The weakness in their relationship is thus shown through their dialogue and in many ways by what they don’t say more than what they do say, just like many others living under oppression. ",
        "Gerardo’s most pivotal weakness throughout the play is further established by his conversation with Roberto in Act 2. Paulina wants Roberto to confess before she can let him go, however, Gerardo being on the Final Commission could face the loss of his job and the very life that he leads if they were to ever be found out. ",
        "As he pleads for Roberto to make up a lie and just confess, we see the conflict that he faces between his job and his wife, as well as what is morally right and wrong. ",
        "Thus, Gerardo’s weakness as evidenced by his dialogue with Roberto demonstrates the difficulty of wanting revenge but also standing up for morality and equanimity. ",
        "Like Dorfman who uses dialogue to convey weaknesses, Fugard uses dialogue between Styles the photographer and Sizwe, now known as Robert, to further establish Sizwe’s individual weakness. ",
        "Unlike in Death and the Maiden, where characters oppose each other and bring out each other’s weakness through argument, Sizwe and Styles are allies as fellow Black South Africans. ",
        "As Sizwe poses for the camera, Styles ends the play with the phrase “Smile...” The irony behind this very phrase lies with Sizwe himself. He is smiling for the camera despite not having very much to smile about. ",
        "For now he is Robert and he is safe to continue working in Port Elizabeth, but one day he will get in trouble again and his fingerprints will not be able to hide who he really is. The phrase “smile...” is written as a temporary end. ",
        "Sizwe’s weakness is his secret and his loss of his identity. When Buntu first switched Sizwe’s passbook with Robert’s, the dead man, Sizwe cannot find it within himself to give up his name. ",
        "Without his name he is no longer the father of his children or the husband of his wife. Just like all Black South Africans of the context, his name is the only thing that he could have that their oppressive society could not take away from them. ",
        "However, by the time he reaches Styles, Sizwe is already Robert, and his weakness is hidden by a “mask of smiles”. ",
        "Breaking the fourth wall is an element of both plays that can be seen as an aid to the development of the character’s individual weaknesses. In DATM, right before the end of the play, Paulina, with a gun pointed at Roberto, repeats again and again, the phrase “What do we lose?”. ",
        "Through the use of inclusive language, Dorfman brings the audience into the problem. And as they are left to contemplate this question a large mirror descends causing them to look upon themselves. ",
        "The characters of DATM are helpless and weak, and it is this inclusion of the audience that further portrays this. ",
        "Perhaps Paulina wants the audience to feel their own weakness as they consider their own role in this cycle of violence. ",
        "SBID too breaks the fourth wall, but instead as a way to criticize their oppressive society and the weakness that its individuals must face. ",
        "Unlike in Dorfman’s play where a mirror descends down, Sizwe and Styles both directly talk to the audience in pivotal moments. ",
        "In the dramatic climax, Sizwe asks the audience, “What’s happening in the world, good people. Look at me. I’m a man.” This direct confrontation forces the audience to see Sizwe’s weakness and to feel what he feels. ",
        "This profound moment is filled with pathos as the audience empathizes with him and relates to the extreme oppression of South African Blacks. ",
        "Perhaps like the mirror descending in DATM, the audience directly feels a part of the problem and understands first hand how weak and powerless these victims of oppression feel. ",
        "Individual weakness is portrayed in literature in order to further develop characters and the societies that they live in. ",
        "In both Death and the Maiden by Ariel Dorfman and Sizwe Banzi is Dead by Athol Fugard, individual weaknesses are created within characters so that the play may represent a microcosm for unjust societies. ",
        "All human beings are weak, and when we accept this, it becomes easier to truly see the truth in this world. ",
        "Both of these works help to show that by recognizing weaknesses, we can strive for fairness, equality and justice for all."
